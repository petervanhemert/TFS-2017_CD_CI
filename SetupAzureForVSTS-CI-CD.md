Create the Azure app service

An Azure App Service is where you'll deploy your application. Technically speaking, an app service is a resource with a specific pricing tier in Azure that can then host multiple, distinct applications. In this example we'll use a Web App. If you're creating a new App Service for this example, you can use the Free pricing tier.

To create a new Web App, simply go to the App Services blade on the Azure portal, click +Add, select the Web App template, click Create, and enter a name and other details. The web app URL will then be {name}.azurewebsites.net.
